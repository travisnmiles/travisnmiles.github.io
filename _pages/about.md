## Research Interests
I am a physical oceanographer with the Rutgers University Center for Ocean Observing Leadership (RUCOOL) that specializes in using networks of underwater robots, remote sensing, and numerical models to understand the coastal ocean environment. I am particularly focused on improving hurricane intensity and impact forecasts for landfalling storms in vulnerable communities.

## Short History

I received my B.S. in Marine science and Meteorology from North Carolina State University (NCSU) in 2007. In 2009 I completed a Master’s in Physical Oceanography also at NCSU under the direction of Professor Ruoying He. I received my PhD from Rutgers University in 2014 studying sediment resuspension and transport during Nor’easters and Hurricanes with Professor Scott Glenn. As an early career scientist I received a Fulbright Scholar award and spent three months at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers University.
